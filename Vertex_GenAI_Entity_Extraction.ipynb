In an exemplary embodi-\\nment, a processor in connection with a memory compaction\\nmodule identifies inefficiencies in array references contained\\nwithin in received source code, allocates a local array and\\nmaps the data from the inefficient array reference to the local\\narray in a manner which improves the memory size require-\\nments for storing and accessing the data. In another embodi-\\nment, a computer software product implementing a local\\nmemory compaction module is provided. In a further embodi-\\nment a computing apparatus is provided. The computing\\napparatus is configured to improve the efficiency of data\\nstorage in array references.
